# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the `wise_knowledge` project - currently in early initialization phase with minimal structure.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── docker/
│   └── compose.yaml    # Docker Compose configuration (currently empty)
```

## Development Setup

The project currently contains only Docker infrastructure scaffolding. As the codebase grows, this section will be updated with:
- Build commands
- Test execution
- Linting and formatting
- Development server setup

## Docker

Docker Compose configuration exists at `docker/compose.yaml` for containerized deployment.
